#✨ Wellcome, I’m Catherine. ✨<br>
Writer, negotiator, purchaser, entrepreneur, and programmer… The list is long. 
##When I started to program:
⚡ the mainframe was in the basement, shielded behind yellow-black-striped tape on the walls. You needed special permission to leave the elevator
⚡ IT was a word no-one heard about and the word computer made the most hardend CEO shiver
⚡ The two main questions you where asked were; "do we really need that?" and "will it explode?"
⚡ your most useful skill was the ability to fast forward thru memory tape and recognize the code by ear
⚡ you probably used the screwdriver as the best used tool after the keyboard
⚡ tinsel was the only way to get paper safely out of a printer and keep some sort of hairdo 

When I programmed my first mobile solution, the mobility was a large truck 🚚 Most of it was battery capacity🔋🔋🔋 a small part a computer💻 the price tag buys a small house 🏠 today. But, we felt like we where braking barriers, new frontiers🚀
No, I'm not ancient, I just started early 😎

##It changed a lot since then
Regardless of what I have done over the years; I always return to coding. It's a tranquility🙏 in it that I like.
I’m a big Drupal fan, and been in the Drupal world since vers 4. So everything you find here is somehow connected to a Drupal project.

📗 My passions for the moment are e-learning and H5P solutions. 
📗 I do some freelancing, but works mostly in-house with the company I run with my husband.
📗 Feel free to contact me if you have an intereseting collaboration or project.
